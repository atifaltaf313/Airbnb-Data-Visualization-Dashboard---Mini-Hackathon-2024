# Airbnb Dashboard - Mini Hackathon 2024

This repository contains the code and design for a dashboard created during a mini-hackathon held in 2024, focused on Airbnb rentals in the Greater Manchester area. The task involved exploring a dataset containing various details about Airbnb properties, such as rental profiles, geographic data, availability, and ratings.

## Objective

The goal was to design a one-page PowerBI dashboard that effectively communicates insights from the Airbnb dataset to a general audience, using principles of data visualization learned in lectures. The dashboard was developed based on the following learning objectives:

- Selecting appropriate data visualizations to communicate key insights
- Designing a dashboard that aligns with specific user objectives
- Applying data visualization theory and best practices in dashboard design

## Dataset

The dataset used was scraped from Airbnb and contained details such as:

- Room types, number of guests, prices, and other rental details
- Availability of rentals over different time periods (30, 60, 90, and 365 days)
- Geographic data including longitude, latitude, and neighborhoods
- Ratings for overall performance and various property attributes

## Features

- **Exploratory Analysis**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the structure and key variables.
- **Dashboard Focus**: The dashboard was designed around key insights like:
  - Which Manchester neighborhoods have the highest Airbnb ratings?
  - Geographic spread of Airbnb rentals in Greater Manchester
  - Profiles of Airbnb rentals in the area
- **Data Visualization**: The dashboard includes various visualizations like bar charts, maps, and scatter plots to present the data effectively.

## Tools

- **PowerBI** for data visualization and dashboard creation

## Outcome

The dashboard successfully combined creativity and data visualization theory to create a product within the 3-hour timeframe of the hackathon.
